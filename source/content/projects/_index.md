**TOTS (Tiered Online Trainings and Supports):** Iterative development of an [online training program](https://totsproject.org/) for caregivers of young children with developmental delay. The program will provide a tiered model of supports, or matched to caregiver need. Currently, I am conducting qualitative interviews and analysis with service providers on their experiences in service provision during the COVID-19 pandemic, to inform intervention development. In 2019, I helped to lead focus groups and engaged in qualitative thematic analysis to investigate stakeholder input from parents. I have also helped to provide content, creating examples to illustrate intervention concepts.

**Systematic Review of Web and Smartphone-Based Parent-Mediated Interventions:** I am currently the lead author on a systematic review of technology based parent trainings for parents of children with ASD. We presented this research in a poster session at [INSAR 2019](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332831720_Systematic_Review_of_Web-and_Smartphone-Based_ASD_Parent_Trainings_Increasing_Access_and_Improving_Outcomes).

**Kid Brain Network:** We aquired resting state fMRI scans of children with previous or current diagnoses of ASD or DD. I help children acclimate to the scanner during mock sessions, and provide behavioral support and safety monitoring during MRI scans. We presented research on how sensory over-responsivity and anxiety contributed to participation and attrition in these scans at [INSAR 2020](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343485989_Anxiety_but_Not_Sensory_Over-Responsivity_Predicts_Attrition_in_Resting_State_fMRI_Research_in_School_Age_Children_with_Autism_and_Developmental_Delay). 

**PRO-Parenting:** We are testing how the efficacy of the Incredible Years intervention changes when caregivers recieve 6 weeks of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction. For this project, I am coding parent-child interaction videos for strategies that are in alignment with intervention targets.

**CogBites:** I am a contributing author to the blog [CogBites](https://cogbites.org/), which aims to provide accessible knowledge about the mind in easy to read, bite size posts. You can read my posts [here](https://cogbites.org/author/epglenn2/).
